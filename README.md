# Trip Reason and Cancellation Prediction

This repository contains two machine learning projects focused on predicting trip reasons and cancellations using the XGBoost algorithm. These projects are part of my Machine Learning course on Quera.

## Project 1: Trip Reason Prediction

- **Description:** Predicts the reason for trips based on various features such as ticket details and passenger demographics.
- **Key Features:** Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training using XGBoost.
- **Usage:** Run the script to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Project 2: Cancellation Prediction

- **Description:** Predicts whether a trip will be canceled based on ticket and customer information.
- **Key Features:** Similar to the first project with tailored preprocessing and evaluation metrics.
- **Usage:** Execute the script to handle data and assess the model's accuracy.
